# CCIP Cross Chain Name Service - Foundry Test

This repository contains a test suite written in Solidity using the Foundry framework. The test focuses on the **CCIP Cross Chain Name Service** (CCNS) implemented using Chainlink's CCIPLocalSimulator. The test simulates registering a name on a source blockchain and verifying that the name resolves to the correct address on both the source and destination blockchains.

## Overview

### Test Contracts

- **CCIPLocalSimulator:** A local simulator provided by Chainlink to test Cross-Chain Interactions.
- **CrossChainNameServiceRegister:** Handles the registration of names on the source chain.
- **CrossChainNameServiceLookup:** Provides lookup functionality to resolve registered names to addresses.
- **CrossChainNameServiceReceiver:** Receives cross-chain messages and handles name resolution on the destination chain.

### Test Scenario

1. **Setup Phase:**

   - Deploy the `CCIPLocalSimulator` contract.
   - Deploy `CrossChainNameServiceRegister` and `CrossChainNameServiceLookup` on the source chain.
   - Deploy `CrossChainNameServiceReceiver` and `CrossChainNameServiceLookup` on the destination chain.
   - Configure the contracts to enable cross-chain communication.

2. **Testing Phase:**
   - **Register a Name:** Register the name `"alice.ccns"` to the address `alice` on the source chain.
   - **Lookup Name:** Retrieve the registered address for `"alice.ccns"` on both the source and destination chains.
   - **Assertions:** Verify that the address retrieved from both chains matches `alice`'s address.

### Key Functions

- **setUp:** Initializes the test environment by deploying contracts and setting up cross-chain communication.
- **testRegisterAndLookup:** Tests the registration and lookup of a name across the source and destination chains.

## How to Run the Tests

1. **Install Foundry:**
   Follow the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to set up Foundry on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shiva-Sai-ssb/CCIP-crossChain-nameService.git
   cd CCIP-crossChain-nameService && cd foundry
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

4. **Run the Tests:**

   ```bash
   forge test -vv
   ```

   This will execute the test file and display the output, including the logs generated by `console.log` statements.

## Test Logs

The test output includes the following key logs:

- Alice's address on the source chain.
- Deployment addresses of the CCIPLocalSimulator, CrossChainNameServiceRegister, and CrossChainNameServiceLookup contracts.
- Chain selector and router addresses.
- Confirmation of successful registration of `"alice.ccns"`.
- Results of the name lookup on both source and destination chains.
